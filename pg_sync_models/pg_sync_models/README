Summary
-------

This repository contains a MATLAB toolbox 'pg_sync_models' for computing
the parameters of the three models for power-grid synchronization
dynamics, as described in

T. Nishikawa and A. E. Motter, Comparative analysis of existing models
for power-grid synchronization, New J. Phys. 17, 015012 (2015).
http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/1/015012

The toolbox also contains data files for four of the example systems discussed
in the article.

README - This file
Contents.m - List of functions

Computing parameters for network dynamics models:

EN_model.m - Effective network model
SP_model.m - Structure-preserving model
SM_model.m - Synchronous motor model

Default methods for estimating dynamic parameters:

default_x_d.m - Transient reactances x'_{d,i}
default_H.m   - Inertia constants H_i
default_D.m   - Damping coefficients D_i

Example systems:

test_system_3gen.m  - 3-generator test system
test_system_10gen.m - 10-generator (New England) test system
test_system_50gen.m - 50-generator test system
poland_case2383wp.m - Poland power grid

Others:

dd50cdf.m - MATPOWER data file for the 50-generator test system
test_system_50gen_dyn_data.mat
          - Dynamic parameters for the 50-generator test system


Installation
------------

Uncompress the zip file and save the toolbox folder ('pg_sync_models')
anywhere you wish and add it to the MATLAB path using addpath.


How to use the software
-----------------------

Once the toolbox folder is added to the MATLAB path, you will be able to
read the help documentation for individual files through 'help EN_model',
etc.  You can get a list of all functions in the toolbox by 'help
pg_sync_models'.
