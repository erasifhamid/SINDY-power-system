# SR3

SR3: Sparse Relaxed Regularized Regression in MATLAB

## About

Information about the SR3 framework and this implementation
can be found in [this preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1807.05411)
and at the [SR3 Website](https://UW-AMO.github.io/software/sr3/).
The source files contain documentation; for an interactive look
at this documentation, open the index.html file from the docs folder
in a web browser.


## Set up and testing

In the top-level folder, run the setup.m routine to add the
folders to your path. The runalltests.m script should 
execute all of the subroutine tests in the test folder
(this is generally only useful for developers).

## demo

See the demo folder for example usage. The results can be 
turned into an HTML page using MATLAB's publish feature.

## Updates

Feel free to submit bug-fix/feature requests through
the issues tab on GitHub.
